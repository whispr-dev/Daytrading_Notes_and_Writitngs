Chapter 6: CNNs, Ensembles, and Deep Visual Forecasting
Charts are just numbers with texture. And few tools capture that texture better than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ‚Äî masters of spatial recognition.

While traditionally used in image classification, CNNs can also detect:

Trend strength and direction

Pattern frequency and volatility zones

Breakout setups and support cluster density

When you combine CNNs with other models into ensembles, you unlock serious power:

Local + Global
Short-term + Long-term
Pattern + Memory

Let‚Äôs build it, fren.

üß† CNNs for Time Series? Yes.
Time series aren‚Äôt images ‚Äî but they have shape.

Example: turning price into a rolling "image":

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

window = 60
segments = []

for i in range(len(data) - window):
    segment = data[i:i+window]
    scaled = MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(segment.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
    segments.append(scaled)

X = np.array(segments).reshape(-1, 60, 1)
Each input is now shaped like an "image" of price over time ‚Äî ready for CNNs.

üõ†Ô∏è CNN Model for Forecasting
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv1D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(60,1)),
    layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    layers.Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  # regression output
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
Use it to predict:

Next return

Probability of breakout

Trend score

üß™ Visual Pattern Recognition
You can even train CNNs to detect specific candle structures by labeling them:

Double top/bottom

Head and shoulders

Triangles

Gaps

Label these patterns manually or from TA-Lib logic, then use CNNs to classify them directly from price windows.

üìö Ensemble Building: CNN + SSM + Tree Models
From [98‚Ä†daytrading_41.txt], ensemble models were built using:

CNN ‚Üí shape recognition (short-term pattern)

SSM ‚Üí long-term dependency and macro memory

XGBoost ‚Üí structured data like volatility, RSI, volume

Meta-model (RandomForest or VotingClassifier) to blend predictions

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[
    ('cnn', cnn_model),
    ('ssm', ssm_model),
    ('tree', xgb_model)
], voting='soft')
This structure gives you robustness + diversity ‚Äî and reduces overfit to any single view.

üìâ Backtest Results: CNN vs Others
From [99‚Ä†daytrading_40.txt], tested on ETH 15-min data:


Model	Accuracy	Sharpe	Max Drawdown
CNN only	64%	1.02	-12.1%
SSM only	68%	1.18	-9.4%
Ensemble (CNN+SSM+XGB)	73%	1.49	-6.3%
The CNN spotted early breakouts, while SSM provided memory, and XGB handled volatility regime.

üß† Visual Explainability
Use Grad-CAM to see which part of the chart influenced a CNN‚Äôs decision:

python
Copy
Edit
# grad-cam visualization logic for CNN time series input
# (omitted for brevity, but available in keras-vis / captum)
This is crucial when pitching models to fund managers, compliance teams, or for your own sanity.
