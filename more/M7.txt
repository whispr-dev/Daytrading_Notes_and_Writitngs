Chapter 7: Visual LLMs and Assisted Trading Agents
You’ve built models that learn.
Now it’s time to build models that see.

This chapter brings together everything we’ve explored and combines it with the latest frontier: Visual LLMs — agents that can interpret your trading screen, read signals like a human, and even suggest entries and exits.

Inspired by agents like OpenAI’s GPT-4V and multimodal frameworks from [100†daytrading_41.txt], we’ll walk through:

Using chart snapshots as inputs to an LLM

Feeding context like sentiment, volatility, or indicators

Building a trading co-pilot that explains signals

Using it to detect bias, reinforce discipline, and generate confidence scores

Welcome to the era of trader augmentation.

🧠 What Is a Visual LLM?
A Visual LLM is a model that combines:

Vision Transformer or CNN encoder (for the image)

Large language model (for reasoning & response)

These models can answer questions like:

“What pattern do you see on this chart?”

“Is this a good time to enter?”

“Why is this not a high-conviction trade?”

They act like a senior analyst that sees what you see.

🖼️ Preparing Chart Inputs
Use matplotlib or mplfinance to generate real-time charts:

python
Copy
Edit
import mplfinance as mpf

mpf.plot(data[-60:], type='candle', savefig='latest_chart.png')
You can then send this to an LLM via API or locally using BLIP, OpenFlamingo, or LLaVA.

🧪 Using BLIP-2 to Caption Charts
Install:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers accelerate
Then use:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import Blip2Processor, Blip2ForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image
import torch

processor = Blip2Processor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b")
model = Blip2ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b", device_map="auto")

image = Image.open("latest_chart.png")
prompt = "Describe the trading opportunity visible in this chart."

inputs = processor(images=image, text=prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
output = model.generate(**inputs)
caption = processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(caption)
Example output:

“A bullish engulfing candle followed by a breakout from horizontal resistance suggests a long entry setup.”

💬 Integrating LLM Feedback into Strategy Logic
Once the LLM gives you a caption or confidence score, you can:

Log it as a textual trade journal

Use it as a filter for model predictions ("Only act if LLM agrees")

Show it on your Streamlit dashboard as assistive signal commentary

🤖 Building the Full Co-Pilot
From [100†daytrading_41.txt], the full co-pilot system includes:

Chart image generator

Context (volatility, pattern flags, macro regime)

Visual LLM caption and assessment

Trade suggestion with rationale

Optional execution layer

Use LangChain or LlamaIndex to pipe everything together as a modular AI agent.

🧠 Live Use Cases

Scenario	LLM Response Example
Chop detected	“Price is oscillating tightly around a flat EMA. No clear trend.”
Double top forming	“Second peak failed to break resistance. Momentum weakening.”
Breakout confirmed	“RSI divergence resolved. Volume spike supports long entry.”
SSM says yes, but LLM disagrees	“Pattern looks unstable. Consider waiting for confirmation.”
These multi-perspective views prevent overconfidence and trigger second-order awareness.

🔐 Safety & Guardrails
Your co-pilot should never execute without logic gates like:

Threshold confidence

Consensus between LLM + model

Exposure caps

Time-based cooldowns

Always think of LLMs as advisors, not traders.
