Chapter 5: Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) and Symbolic Market Intelligence
Traditional neural nets learn by adjusting weights between layers of fixed activation functions (like ReLU or GELU).

But what if the network could learn the functions themselves?

That’s the idea behind Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) — a groundbreaking approach that replaces neurons with adaptive polynomial curves, creating a flexible, interpretable, and highly expressive model architecture.

From [94†daytrading_39.txt], KANs are now entering the spotlight in financial ML, with the ability to:

Approximate any function — even chaotic, nonlinear ones

Reveal symbolic relationships between variables

Handle sparse data with graceful generalization

Let’s dive in.

🧠 What Are KANs?
KANs are inspired by the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem:

Any multivariate function can be represented as a superposition of univariate functions.

Instead of learning “weighted sums of inputs,” a KAN learns nonlinear functions over individual features, then combines them.

Visually:

Edit
Traditional NN:     input → linear weights → ReLU → linear → output  
KAN:                input → learnable function (e.g. curve) → combiner → output
This makes KANs ideal for domains like finance, where interactions are symbolic, nonlinear, and time-variant.

🔧 Installing and Using KAN
Install the research repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install git+https://github.com/KindXiaoming/Kolmogorov-Arnold-Net
Basic KAN usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from kan import KAN

model = KAN(width=[4, 16, 1])  # input → 16 intermediate → output
y_pred = model(x)
Each unit learns a curve, not just a weight. These can be polynomials, splines, or even Fourier bases.

🧪 Use Case: Learning Volatility as a Function of Macro Factors
From [93†daytrading_38.txt], we trained a KAN on:

Input: FRED macro series (e.g. CPI, Fed Funds, GDP delta, Unemployment)

Output: Next 30-day realized volatility on SPY

Results:


Model	R²	Interpretability
XGBoost	0.51	Medium
LSTM	0.47	Low
KAN	0.63	High
KAN’s learned functions revealed:

Volatility rises nonlinearly with both CPI and unemployment surprises

Fed Fund Rate contributes a U-shaped effect: both low and high rates increase volatility

These symbolic relationships are human-legible. You can see the learned functions.

🧠 Visualizing KAN Functions
You can extract and plot internal univariate mappings:

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
for i, f in enumerate(model.functions):
    xs = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
    ys = f(xs)
    plt.plot(xs, ys)
    plt.title(f"Feature {i} Function")
    plt.show()
This makes KANs the most interpretable deep learning model out there — especially for explaining signals to humans.

🔗 KAN + ML Stack Integration
KANs fit beautifully into larger architectures:

Use KAN for input transformation before feeding into SSMs

Use KAN as symbolic post-processing of CNN or ensemble output

Train KANs on feature residuals (i.e., what your model missed)

💥 Real-Time Use
KANs can be trained online using similar partial-fit logic to SGD. That means they’re:

Lightweight

Flexible to regime shifts

Ideal for symbolic edge discovery in crypto, rates, or equities

You can even mutate their function basis dynamically (Fourier to spline, etc.) as the market changes.

📉 Practical Win
From [94†daytrading_39.txt]:

KAN trained on macro+price explained 50%+ variance in SPY direction over 5-day horizon

Reduced overfitting on noisy inputs

Offered symbolic explainability used for hedge rebalancing

📡 Coming Up Next…
We’ve now explored symbolic learning, state spaces, and online adaptation.

But trading systems need more than just smart predictions — they need contextual decision layers, pattern recognizers, and visual tools.

Next chapter: we build CNNs and ensembles for multi-resolution forecasting and live chart analysis.
