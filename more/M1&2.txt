More Daytrading with Python Machine Learning
Advanced Models, Smarter Strategies, and Real Returns from the Edge of Quant Innovation
Chapter 1: Introduction – The Edge Evolves
In the world of daytrading, everyone has a chart.
Everyone has an opinion.
And most are wrong.

But you? You’ve moved beyond gut feel. You think in code, in models, in probabilities. You build systems that learn, evolve, and adapt. In this third volume, we dive deep into machine learning’s most advanced frontiers — ones barely entering mainstream quant literature.

You’ll learn:

How to use Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) to build universal function approximators from scratch

The power of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) to capture long-range dependencies better than Transformers or LSTMs

Dual-momentum strategies grounded in robust statistical backtests

Applying online learning and incremental updates to adapt in real time

Real-world examples of deep learning models (CNNs, ensembles) deployed in live markets

Integration with LLMs and visual agents for assisted trading

This isn’t just machine learning. It’s machine intuition — baked into code.

Chapter 2: Momentum Strategies Reimagined with ML
Before we dive into exotic architectures, let’s return to a timeless alpha factor: momentum.

The idea is simple: assets that went up tend to keep going up — until they don’t. But most people use momentum wrong. They oversimplify, overfit, or ignore context.

Let’s fix that.

🧠 What Is Momentum, Really?
Momentum = relative strength over time.

python
Copy
Edit
def momentum(series, lookback=20):
    return series / series.shift(lookback) - 1
This gives you a % change over the past lookback periods. But dual momentum goes further:

Combine absolute momentum (price vs its own history)
With relative momentum (asset vs other assets)

📈 A Dual Momentum Strategy
From [91†daytrading_36.txt], we build a dual-momentum screen:

1. Rank Assets by Recent Returns
python
Copy
Edit
def rank_assets(price_df, lookback=90):
    momentum_scores = price_df.pct_change(lookback).iloc[-1]
    return momentum_scores.sort_values(ascending=False)
2. Select Top 3 (Relative Strength)
python
Copy
Edit
top_assets = rank_assets(price_df).head(3)
3. Filter by Absolute Strength
python
Copy
Edit
threshold = 0.05  # e.g., must be up 5% over period
selected = top_assets[top_assets > threshold]
4. Equal Weight Portfolio
python
Copy
Edit
weights = pd.Series(1 / len(selected), index=selected.index)
🔁 ML-Enhanced Momentum Scoring
From [89†daytrading_34.txt], we learn to blend momentum with trend features like:

Slope of linear regression

RSI divergence

Laguerre filter acceleration

PCA compression of price movement

Train an ML model (e.g. XGBoost or RandomForest) to learn non-linear relationships:

python
Copy
Edit
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y = did price outperform in next 10d?
Use momentum as one of many inputs — not a lone signal.

🧪 Monte Carlo Testing
Robust backtests include:

Multiple lookback periods (30/60/90)

Random entry days

Volatility-adjusted sizing

Rolling rebalancing every N days

Use vectorbt to run 1000s of variations and rank by Sharpe, drawdown, turnover.

📉 Real Results
Backtests in [91†daytrading_36.txt] across 10 global equity ETFs:

Dual-momentum Sharpe: 1.42 vs baseline 0.93

Reduced whipsaw trades in sideways regimes

Higher win rate in low-volatility macro periods

🧠 Closing Thoughts
Momentum is one of the few signals that has survived decades of testing — but it needs context.

By:

Combining absolute + relative views

Using ML for scoring + regime detection

Stress-testing via Monte Carlo

…you turn a basic idea into a reliable, multi-asset strategy engine.

Next, we’ll evolve again — into a world of online learners, where models update in real-time without retraining from scratch.
