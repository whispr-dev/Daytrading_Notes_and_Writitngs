Hey there, traders and tech enthusiasts! 🎉 Have you ever wondered how you could combine price charts, technical indicators, and real-time news sentiment into one powerful tool for day trading? Well… wait no more! 🚀

I’m thrilled to introduce this new and shiny Streamlit app that brings everything you need to level up your trading strategy. 📊

Imagine this: You’re keeping a close eye on the AAPL stock, but you also want quick access to the latest news without leaving the chart. What if you could analyze the sentiment behind those news articles at the same time? 🤔

We’ll break down the app’s exciting features, how to use them, and sprinkle in some easy-to-understand code snippets to get you started… Let’s dive in! 🌊

1. 📊 Candlestick Chart with Custom EMA
Want to visualize the latest price trends and spot opportunities on the fly? Our app features candlestick charts with Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to make your decision-making easier. 🔍

Select your preferred EMAs — whether it’s the 9-day, 20-day, or 50-day, or all of them! Customize how you analyze price movement like never before. 🎯

data = add_ema(data, selected_emas)
fig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(...))
for period in selected_emas:
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(...))
With a few lines of code, this beauty updates in real-time with your chosen stock and interval… Fancy, right? 😏

2. 📉 RSI and MACD? You Bet!
We didn’t stop at just EMAs… Want to check out the stock’s momentum and spot those overbought/oversold zones? Toggle the RSI (Relative Strength Index) with a click! ✔️

Need to dig deeper into trend reversals and crossovers? Just flip the switch and add the MACD indicator to your chart. 📉

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=data.index, y=data['RSI'], ...))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=data.index, y=data['MACD'], ...))
Super useful for all you indicator geeks out there! 🧠💼


3. 📰 Real-Time News with Sentiment Analysis… Plus a Total Score!
Now… let’s add a twist! Ever wonder if a piece of news is going to drive the stock price up or down? 🚀📉 Thanks to the magic of NLP (Natural Language Processing), we’re pulling real-time news from Yahoo Finance and running sentiment analysis on the headlines using VADER. 💬

That’s right! You’ll see whether the news is Positive (📈), Negative (📉), or Neutral (🤔). But here’s the real kicker… this app doesn’t just give you the news headlines — it calculates a total sentiment score that reflects the overall mood of all recent news combined! 😎

def get_vader_sentiment(text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    return sia.polarity_scores(text)
If the score is positive, things are looking good; if it’s negative, you might want to tread carefully. The total score helps you gauge the market’s mood at a glance before making your moves! 🧠💥

This feature can seriously make the difference in spotting trends before the market reacts! 😎💥


4. ⏱ Fine-Tune Your Chart with Different Time Intervals
Time to sharpen your strategy… You can choose different time intervals — from 1 minute to 5 minutes and 15 minutes — to get the level of detail you need. 🔍

Whether you’re looking for fast-paced action or a slightly broader view of the price movement, the choice is yours! ⏳ Just pick the interval that best suits your trading style, and the chart instantly updates. How cool is that?

ticker = st.sidebar.text_input('Enter Stock Symbol', 'AAPL').upper()
interval = st.sidebar.selectbox('Select Interval', ['1m', '5m', '15m'], index=1)
5. 🔥 Empower Your Trading Game
This isn’t just another charting tool… it’s your all-in-one dashboard for trading smarter, faster, and more confidently. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, the combination of technical analysis and sentiment insights can be your secret weapon! 🏆
