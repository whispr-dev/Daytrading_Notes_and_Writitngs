Ever dreamed of conquering the stock market from the comfort of your home office? Buckle up, day traders! We’re about to dive into a Python-powered tool that might just be your new secret weapon. 💻💹

And the best part? You can try it right now at https://cwkjqumxnopvjzohsv3tdc.streamlit.app/ 🎉

The Day Trader’s Crystal Ball
Picture this: a Streamlit app that’s not just another stock tracker, but a veritable command center for day trading operations. This isn’t about long-term holds; it’s about seizing those lightning-fast opportunities that define day trading success. ⚡📈

Let’s peek behind the curtain…

1. Real-Time Data: The Lifeblood of Day Trading 🕰️
Our app taps directly into the pulsing veins of Yahoo Finance, fetching data at intervals that matter to day traders:

def fetch_data(stock_symbol, interval, yf_period):
    try:
        data = yf.download(stock_symbol, period=yf_period, interval=interval)
        if data.empty:
            st.error(f"No data returned for ticker {stock_symbol}. Please check the ticker symbol or interval.")
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error fetching data from Yahoo Finance: {e}")
        return pd.DataFrame()
This function is the heartbeat of our app. It uses the yfinance library to download real-time stock data. You can choose 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute intervals, because in day trading, every second counts!

2. Support and Resistance: Your Intraday Battlegrounds 🏋️‍♂️
Day traders live and die by support and resistance levels. Our app calculates these crucial intraday levels in real-time:

def calculate_support_resistance(data, window=20):
    data['Support'] = data['Low'].rolling(window=window).min()
    data['Resistance'] = data['High'].rolling(window=window).max()
    return data['Support'].iloc[-1], data['Resistance'].iloc[-1]
This function uses a rolling window to determine support and resistance levels, giving you the edge in identifying potential breakouts or reversals.

3. Anomaly Detection: Spotting Intraday Tsunamis 🌊
Here’s where it gets really exciting for day traders. We’re using the Lorentzian distance algorithm to hunt for explosive intraday anomalies:

def lorentzian_distance(x, y):
    return np.log(1 + (x - y)**2)

# Compute Lorentzian distances
lorentzian_distances = [lorentzian_distance(data_returns[i], data_returns[i + 1]) for i in range(len(data_returns) - 1)]
This code calculates the Lorentzian distance between consecutive returns, helping identify unusual price movements. It’s like having a personal alarm system for market irregularities!

4. News Integration: Because Headlines Move Markets 📰
In the world of day trading, a single news headline can send a stock soaring… or plummeting. Our app pulls in real-time news:

def fetch_stock_news(stock_symbol):
    url = "https://finance.yahoo.com/rss/headline?s=" + stock_symbol
    feed = feedparser.parse(url)
    articles = []
    for entry in feed.entries:
        articles.append({
            'title': entry.title,
            'publishedAt': entry.published,
            'url': entry.link
        })
    return articles
This function fetches the latest news articles related to your chosen stock, ensuring you’re always ahead of the curve.


Visualize Your Way to Victory 📊
Day trading is as much about intuition as it is about data. That’s why our app comes equipped with interactive charts using Plotly:

fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(
    x=data.index,
    open=data['Open'],
    high=data['High'],
    low=data['Low'],
    close=data['Close'],
    name='Candlestick'
))
This code creates beautiful candlestick charts, complete with clearly marked support and resistance levels and highlighted anomalies. All of this, updating in real-time as you trade. It’s like having a Bloomberg terminal… but cooler. 😎

But Wait… Is This the Ultimate Day Trading Tool?
Let’s be real for a moment…

While this tool is powerful, remember that day trading is incredibly risky. No tool, no matter how sophisticated, can guarantee profits. What our app does is arm you with information and insights, faster and more comprehensively than ever before.
