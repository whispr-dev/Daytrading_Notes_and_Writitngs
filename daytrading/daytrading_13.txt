When working in or founding a startup connected to the financial markets, you will inevitably need stock data at some point. At that time, you’ll face a decision on how to obtain it. On one hand, you can spend significant resources building data pipelines to scrape data from various sources, which comes with considerable complexity. This includes finding reliable sources, developing a service that reads real-time data, storing that data for further analysis, and scaling across multiple markets. This is certainly not a small project.

On the other hand, you can use an established data provider to get your stock prices, allowing you to focus on your company’s core business activities — the ones that give you a competitive edge and that might have inspired you to join or start the company in the first place.

In this article, we will take a look at the leading providers of real-time stock prices. But first, we need to answer a very important question.

What to look out for when choosing a data provider?
When choosing a data provider, we should consider quite a few factors, including:

Data Accuracy — As the famous adage goes, garbage in, garbage out. That is why we need to ensure the provider delivers accurate and reliable data since our business depends on it.
Coverage — Depending on our use case, we should verify that the provider covers all the markets and financial instruments we might need.
Historical Data — Real-time data is one thing, but we will likely also need accurate historical data for analysis and backtesting trading strategies.
API Performance and Stability — The provider’s API needs to be stable and perform well under various conditions, especially as the startup grows and increases its number of requests. Consistent data access is crucial for financial applications.
Latency — If we depend on real-time data, low latency is crucial.
Security and Compliance — The provider should adhere to industry standards for security and comply with relevant regulations.
Support and Documentation — Any engineer will swear by it: good support and comprehensive documentation are essential for smooth integration with any service and potential troubleshooting.
Cost — Naturally, we couldn’t skip this one. You need to ensure that the service you are getting is good value for money and fits your budget.
Now that we know what to look for when considering data providers, let’s explore the best providers currently on the market.

Wrapping up
We have explored 8 of the most popular financial data providers. It is still difficult to say which one is the best, as each offers unique features to attract clients. My personal advice would be to thoroughly review what is accessible via their API. Ideally, start with a free tier (for example, with FMP) to explore the data and determine if it meets your needs. Only decide to a purchase when you are 100% sure that the provider offers exactly what you need and that you would get a good value for money.

I’d be curious to hear about your experience with obtaining financial data! Do you have a favorite provider? Maybe I have missed something? You can reach out to me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or in the comments :)
