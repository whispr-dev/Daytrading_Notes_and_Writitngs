Unleashing the power of Neural Networks for creating Trading Bot for maximum profits.

Introduction:
Welcome to the next chapter of our exploration into the cutting-edge world of algorithmic trading, where machine learning and data-driven strategies converge to unlock unparalleled profitability. My journey in developing sophisticated trading systems has been marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation, consistently pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in financial markets. This drive has yielded impressive returns, earning the trust and admiration of the trading community.

Continuing this tradition of excellence, I recently unveiled a groundbreaking ensemble model that combines the strengths of multiple neural network architectures — TCN, CNN, and LSTM — into a single, powerful trading algorithm. This ensemble, comprised of six carefully selected models, represents the pinnacle of machine learning in trading, delivering a staggering 66,941.5% return on ETHUSDT in backtesting over the 15-minute timeframe.

However, it’s important to note that backtesting results, while impressive, should be viewed as the best possible scenario, not a guarantee of future performance. As the saying goes, “If such high returns were consistently achievable, everyone would become a Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates in no time.” Backtests serve as an indication of a model’s potential, giving algorithmic traders insights into its strengths and weaknesses, such as win rate, Sharpe ratio, and drawdowns. Yet, the true test of a trading strategy lies in live market conditions.

For a good algo trader, patience, perseverance, and discipline are essential for long-term success. The goal is to make steady income through trading, with compounded profits eventually growing into significant wealth over time. This is where live trading comes into play. Though we started with a modest capital of only 20 USDT per trade, the bot was able to generate decent profits over a span of 7 days on a capital base of 1,000 USDT.

In this article, we dive deep into the transformative power of ensemble learning in the context of financial markets. We will explore how the strategic combination of Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) has been instrumental in capturing complex patterns within Ethereum’s 15-minute candlestick data, spanning from January 2nd, 2021, to August 20th, 2024. By harnessing over 1326 days of trading data, this advanced model not only meets but exceeds the high expectations set by its predecessors.

Our journey is one of constant innovation and refinement, driven by a passion to unlock the full potential of machine learning in trading. In this article, I invite you to join me as we explore the evolution from single-model approaches to this sophisticated ensemble method, setting a new standard in the cryptocurrency trading landscape.

Our Algorithmic Trading Vs/+ Machine Learning Vs/+ Deep Learning Journey so far?
Stage 1:
We have developed a crypto Algorithmic Strategy which gave us huge profits when ran on multiple crypto assets (138+) with a profit range of 8787%+ in span of 3 years (almost).

We have run live trading in dry-run mode for the same for 7 days and details about the same have been shared in another article.

“Freqtrade Revealed: 7-Day Journey in Algorithmic Trading for Crypto Futures Market” — Link
After successful backtest results and forward testing (live trading in dry-run mode), we planned to improve the odds of making more profit for the same. (To lower stop-losses, increase odds of winning more , reduce risk factor and other important things)

Stage 2:
We have worked on developing a strategy alone without freqtrade setup (avoiding trailing stop loss, multiple asst parallel running, higher risk management setups that freqtrade provides for free (it is a free open source platform) and then tested it in market, then optimized it using hyper parameters and then , we got some +ve profits from the strategy

“How I achieved 3000+% Profit in Backtesting for Various Algorithmic Trading Bots and how you can do the same for your Trading Strategies — Using Python Code” — Link
Stage 3:
As we have tested our strategy only on 1 Asset , i.e; BTC/USDT in crypto market, we wanted to know if we can segregate the whole collective assets we have (Which we have used for developing Freqtrade Strategy earlier) segregate them into different clusters based on their volatility, it becomes easy to do trading for certain volatile assets and won’t hit huge stop-losses for others if worked on implementing based on coin volatility.

We used K-nearest Neighbors (KNN Means) to identify different clusters of assets out of 138 crypto assets we use in our freqtrade strategy, which gave us 8000+% profits during backtest.

Stage 4:
Now, we want to introduce Unsupervised Machine Learning model — Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) to identify trends in the market and trade during only profitable trends and avoid sudden pumps, dumps in market, avoid negative trends in market. Below explanation unravels the same.

“Hyper Optimized Algorithmic Strategy Vs/+ Machine Learning Models Part -2 (Hidden Markov Model — HMM)” — Link
Stage 5:
I worked on using XGBoost Classifier to identify long and short trades using our old signal. Before using it, we ensured that the signal algorithm we had previously developed was hyper-optimized. Additionally, we introduced different stop-loss and take-profit parameters for this setup, causing the target values to change accordingly. We also adjusted the parameters used for obtaining profitable trades based on the stop-loss and take-profit values. Later, we tested the basic XGBClassifier setup and then enhanced the results by adding re-sampling methods. Our target classes, which include 0’s (neutral), 1’s (for long trades), and 2’s (for short trades), were imbalanced due to the trade execution timing. To address this imbalance, we employed re-sampling methods and performed hyper-optimization of the classifier model. Subsequently, we evaluated if the model performed better with other classifier models such as SVC, CatBoost, and LightGBM, in combination with LSTM and XGBoost. Finally, we concluded by analyzing the results and determining feature importance parameters to identify the most productive features.

Stage 6:
In that stage, I utilized the CatBoostClassifier along with resampling and sample weights. I incorporated multiple time frame indicators such as volume, momentum, trend, and volatility into my model. After running the model, I performed ensembling techniques to enhance its overall performance. The results of my analysis showed a significant increase in profit from 54% to over 4600% during backtesting. Additionally, I highlighted the impressive performance metrics including recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 score, all exceeding 80% for each of the three trading classes (0 for neutral, 1 for long, and 2 for short trades).

Stage 7:
In this stage, the ensemble method combining TCN and LSTM neural network models has demonstrated exceptional performance across various datasets, outperforming individual models and even surpassing buy and hold strategies. This underscores the effectiveness of ensemble learning in improving prediction accuracy and robustness.

Stage 8:
The LSTM time series classification model has proven to be a valuable tool for predicting Ethereum price movements and generating profitable trading signals. Despite the high volatility and substantial drawdowns, the model’s robust returns and positive expectancy demonstrate its potential in algorithmic trading.

Stage 10:
This article describes a cryptocurrency trading system that utilizes a neural network model (specifically a 2D CNN model) and a trading bot called VishvaAlgo. Here’s a breakdown:

Data and Model Training:

The system downloads historical data for over 250+ cryptocurrency assets on Binance Futures from TradingView.
It trains a 2D CNN-based neural network model, achieving a claimed return of 9,800%+ on Ethereum (ETHUSDT) in 3 years on a 15-minutes time frame data with over 100,000 rows trained model with 193+ features used for finding the best possible estimation for going neutral, long and short using the classification based 2D CNN model. (important to note: this returns vary from system to system based on trained data and needs re-verification).
“9,883+% Returns in 3 years on Cryptocurrency using 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model and short listing Best Assets for Trading — VishvaAlgo Machine Learning Trading Bot” — Link
Stage 11:
The journey through this exploration of a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model’s performance in cryptocurrency trading reveals an astonishing result: a 152,293% return on ETH over a span of more than three years. This outcome not only highlights the immense potential of advanced neural networks in financial markets but also addresses the critical concern of overfitting — a common challenge in machine learning.

Despite facing class imbalance and lower F1-scores for the minority classes (long and short positions), the TCN model demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize and avoid overfitting. The model effectively focused on the dominant class (neutral), minimizing unnecessary risk and optimizing trade decisions. Through the integration of stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms, the strategy further ensured that gains were maximized while losses were kept in check, leading to a profitable outcome.

The combination of a solid neural network architecture, strategic risk management, and precise, albeit selective, predictions contributed to the strategy’s success. The Sharpe Ratio of 0.73 and the Sortino Ratio of 13.39 underscore the model’s efficiency in handling downside risk while generating substantial returns.

In essence, this breakthrough in crypto trading wasn’t solely about the raw predictive power of the TCN model. It was the model’s ability to navigate complex market conditions, effectively manage risk, and deliver consistent, high returns that truly unlocked the potential for such extraordinary gains. This achievement showcases how neural networks, when carefully crafted and strategically applied, can revolutionize trading strategies and push the boundaries of what’s possible in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.

Now, Stage 12: The Power of Ensemble Learning
As we continued to push the boundaries of algorithmic trading, the natural progression was to combine the strengths of multiple models — LSTM, CNN, and TCN — into a single, powerful ensemble model. This approach allowed us to harness the unique capabilities of each model, creating a robust system that excelled in predicting market movements across various scenarios.

In this stage, we developed an ensemble model comprised of six neural network models — two LSTM, two CNN, and two TCN models — each meticulously trained and optimized to perform under different market conditions. By assigning strategic weights to each model based on its performance, we created a composite system that delivered a staggering 66,941.5% return on ETHUSDT in a 15-minute timeframe.

The ensemble model’s success was rooted in its ability to balance the predictive power of TCNs with the temporal awareness of LSTMs and the spatial recognition capabilities of CNNs. This synergy enabled the model to capture complex patterns in the market, making accurate predictions for neutral, long, and short positions. Despite the challenges of class imbalance and market volatility, the ensemble approach provided a resilient solution, maximizing returns while effectively managing risk.

In this article, we will delve deeper into the mechanics of this ensemble model, exploring the data preprocessing, feature selection, and weighting strategies that made it possible. We will also compare the performance of the ensemble model to individual models and discuss how this innovative approach has redefined our algorithmic trading strategy.

By integrating these diverse neural networks into a cohesive system, we’ve not only achieved unprecedented profitability but also set a new standard for algorithmic trading in the cryptocurrency market. This stage represents the culmination of our journey so far, highlighting the transformative potential of ensemble learning in financial markets.

Step-by-Step Explanation of Above Code:
Understanding the Code for Our Ensemble Model
Importing Necessary Libraries:

from keras.models import load_model, save_model
from tcn import TCN
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import joblib
We start by importing the necessary libraries that will help us load our pre-trained models, work with TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks), and manage our neural network backend. We also import joblib, a useful tool for saving and loading Python objects, like our ensemble model.

load_model and save_model: These functions from Keras allow us to load models that we've previously trained and saved, and also save new models.
TCN: This is the specific implementation of Temporal Convolutional Networks, which we're using in our ensemble.
K: This is the backend that Keras uses, which helps us manage low-level operations like tensor manipulation.
joblib: We use this to save the ensemble model in a way that's easy to load later.
Loading the Pre-Trained Models:

loaded_model_cnn_2d_1 = load_model('./models/cnn/cnn_model_2d_ETH_USDT_USDT-15m-futures_SL25.0_TP25.0_ShRa_1.23_Return_423.7_MaxDrawDown_-23.71_WinRate_56.76_time_2024_08_21_18_12_13.keras')
loaded_model_cnn_2d_2 = load_model('./models/cnn/cnn_model_2d_ETH_USDT_USDT-15m-futures_SL25.0_TP25.0_ShRa_1.0_Return_232.54_MaxDrawDown_-26.2_WinRate_54.55_time_2024_08_21_20_54_31.keras')
Here, we load two different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that were trained on 15-minute candlestick data for the ETH/USDT trading pair. These models are stored in specific files, and by using load_model, we bring them into our program so we can use them for predictions.

Each model has a file name that includes important information like stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) levels, Sharpe Ratio (ShRa), and other performance metrics. This helps us quickly identify the characteristics of each model.

Loading LSTM and TCN Models:

loaded_lstm_balanced = load_model('./models/lstm/model_lstm_Balanced_ETH_USDT_USDT-15m-futures_SL25.0_TP25.0_ShRa_0.82_Return_43.81_MaxDrawDown_-17.86_WinRate_54.55_time_2024_08_21_08_48_24.keras')
loaded_lstm_balanced_2 = load_model('./models/lstm/model_lstm_Balanced_ETH_USDT_USDT-15m-futures_SL25.0_TP25.0_ShRa_0.76_Return_47.03_MaxDrawDown_-20.32_WinRate_54.29_time_2024_08_21_05_44_29.keras')
loaded_tcn_rolling_manual_1 = load_model('./models/tcn/tcn_manual_2Dconv_lstm_model_ETH_USDT_USDT-15m-futures_SL25.0_TP25.0_ShRa_1.02_Return_212.68_MaxDrawDown_-27.78_WinRate_54.23_time_2024_08_21_17_48_13.keras')
loaded_tcn_rolling_manual_2 = load_model('./models/tcn/tcn_manual_2Dconv_lstm_model_ETH_USDT_USDT-15m-futures_SL25.0_TP25.0_ShRa_0.88_Return_95.42_MaxDrawDown_-24.22_WinRate_53.85_time_2024_08_23_16_20_04.keras')
Similarly, we load two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and two TCN models. These models were trained to predict future price movements based on past data. Just like the CNN models, these have detailed names that tell us about their training and performance metrics.

LSTM Models: These are especially good at understanding sequences over time, like price movements in the market.
TCN Models: These are newer and can often outperform LSTMs in time series tasks by capturing complex patterns in the data.
Defining Weights for Each Model:

weights = {
    "model_cnn_2d_1": 0.1,
    "model_cnn_2d_2": 0.1,
    
    "lstm_balanced": 0.15,
    "lstm_balanced_2": 0.15,
    
    "tcn_rolling_manual_1": 0.25,
    "tcn_rolling_manual_2": 0.25
}
Next, we assign a weight to each model. These weights determine how much influence each model’s predictions will have on the final ensemble prediction. For example, the TCN models are given more weight (0.25 each) because they might have performed better during testing, while the CNN models have a slightly lower weight (0.1 each).

The idea is to give more importance to the models that are more reliable or accurate, while still considering the input from all models.

Creating the Ensemble Prediction Function:

def ensemble_predict(X):
Here, we define a function called ensemble_predict. This function takes X as input, which represents the data we want to predict on (like new candlestick data for ETH/USDT).

Getting Predictions from Each Model:

probs_model_cnn_2d_1 = loaded_model_cnn_2d_1.predict(X)
    probs_model_cnn_2d_2 = loaded_model_cnn_2d_2.predict(X)
    probs_lstm_balanced = loaded_lstm_balanced.predict(X)
    probs_lstm_balanced_2 = loaded_lstm_balanced_2.predict(X)
    
    probs_tcn_rolling_manual_1 = loaded_tcn_rolling_manual_1.predict(X)
    probs_tcn_rolling_manual_2 = loaded_tcn_rolling_manual_2.predict(X)
Within this function, we use each loaded model to predict the output for the input data X. The .predict() function gives us the probabilities for each class (neutral, long, short) based on the input data. We do this for all six models.

Combining the Predictions Using Weights:

ensemble_probs = (
        probs_model_cnn_2d_1 * weights["model_cnn_2d_1"] +
        probs_model_cnn_2d_2 * weights["model_cnn_2d_2"] +
        
        probs_lstm_balanced * weights["lstm_balanced"] + 
        probs_lstm_balanced_2 * weights["lstm_balanced_2"] + 
        
        probs_tcn_rolling_manual_1 * weights["tcn_rolling_manual_1"]  +
        probs_tcn_rolling_manual_2 * weights["tcn_rolling_manual_2"]
    )
Next, we combine the predictions from all six models, using the weights we defined earlier. This line of code multiplies each model’s predictions by its respective weight and then adds them all together. The result is a set of combined probabilities that take into account the performance of each model.

Making the Final Prediction:

ensemble_predictions = np.argmax(ensemble_probs, axis=1)
    return ensemble_predictions
Finally, we decide on the final prediction by selecting the class (neutral, long, or short) that has the highest combined probability. The np.argmax() function does this by finding the index of the maximum value in ensemble_probs for each sample. The function then returns these final predictions.

Saving the Ensemble Model:

joblib.dump(ensemble_predict, './models/ensemble_nn_6_models_lstm_cnn2D_tcn_Aug_23_2024.keras')
After defining our ensemble prediction function, we save it using joblib. This allows us to load and use this ensemble model later without having to redefine everything

Loading the Model, Plotting Classification Report & Confusion Matrix:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import joblib

# Load the ensemble_predict function using joblib
ensemble_predict = joblib.load('./models/ensemble_nn_6_models_lstm_cnn2D_tcn_Aug_23_2024.keras')

# Make predictions using the ensemble model
y_pred = ensemble_predict(X_test)

# Visualize the classification results
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Plot the confusion matrix
def plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, classes):
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=classes, yticklabels=classes)
    plt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')
    plt.ylabel('True Labels')
    plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
    plt.show()

# Define your class labels
class_labels = ['Class 1', 'Class 2', 'Class 3']

# Plot the confusion matrix
plot_confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, class_labels)
Output:

Let’s go through the code step by step:
1. Importing Necessary Libraries:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import joblib
numpy: A library used for working with arrays and numerical operations.
matplotlib.pyplot: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
sklearn.metrics: Provides functions for measuring classification performance like confusion_matrix and classification_report.
seaborn: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
joblib: Used to load the pre-saved ensemble model that we created earlier.
2. Loading the Ensemble Prediction Function:

ensemble_predict = joblib.load('./models/ensemble_nn_6_models_lstm_cnn2D_tcn_Aug_23_2024.keras')
Here, we load the ensemble model that we saved previously. The joblib.load function retrieves our ensemble prediction function from the saved file.

3. Making Predictions Using the Ensemble Model:

y_pred = ensemble_predict(X_test)
With the ensemble model loaded, we use it to predict the outcomes (y_pred) for the test data (X_test). The predictions are the model's guesses for each sample in the test set.

4. Visualizing the Classification Results:

print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
We print out a classification report which provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. These metrics help us understand how well the model is performing on each category.

5. Plotting the Confusion Matrix:

def plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, classes):
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=classes, yticklabels=classes)
    plt.xlabel('Predicted Labels')
    plt.ylabel('True Labels')
    plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
    plt.show()
This function creates a confusion matrix, which visually represents the performance of the classification model. It shows the counts of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred): Computes the confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification.
sns.heatmap: Used to create a heatmap from the confusion matrix values, with annotations to show exact numbers.
6. Defining Class Labels:

class_labels = ['Class 1', 'Class 2', 'Class 3']
Here, we define the labels for the classes. These will be used as labels in the confusion matrix.

7. Plotting the Confusion Matrix:

plot_confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, class_labels)
Finally, we call the plot_confusion_matrix function to display the confusion matrix using the true labels (y_test) and the predicted labels (y_pred).

The data used for training this ensemble model is highly imbalanced, with Class 0 (neutral positions) making up a significant majority of the dataset, while Classes 1 (long positions) and 2 (short positions) together constitute around only 10% of the total data. This kind of imbalance can make it challenging for a model to learn to accurately predict the minority classes (1 and 2), as the model might be biased toward predicting the majority class (0).

Steps Taken to Address Data Imbalance
During the training process, several strategies were employed to mitigate the effects of this imbalance:

Class Weights:
Balanced Weights: During the training of the TCN, LSTM, and CNN models, custom class weights were applied. These weights penalize the model more for making errors on the minority classes (1 and 2) than on the majority class (0). This encourages the model to pay more attention to the underrepresented classes, helping to improve recall and precision for those classes.
2. Resampling Techniques:

Oversampling the Minority Classes: Techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or simple random oversampling could have been used to create synthetic samples for Classes 1 and 2, making them more balanced with Class 0.
Undersampling the Majority Class: In some scenarios, the majority class data (Class 0) might be undersampled to balance the dataset, though this can lead to loss of information.
3. Hybrid Approaches:

Ensemble Model Weighting: In the ensemble model, different models were assigned weights based on their performance, which could help balance the predictive accuracy across all classes. For example, TCN models might have been more effective in capturing the minority class patterns, and thus were given higher weights in the ensemble.
Analysis of the Classification Report
Class 0 (Neutral):
Precision (0.94) and Recall (0.92) are very high, indicating that the model performs exceptionally well at predicting neutral positions. This is expected given the abundance of Class 0 data, which allows the model to learn this class more effectively.
F1-Score (0.93) is strong, reflecting a good balance between precision and recall for Class 0.
Class 1 (Long):
Precision (0.47) is moderate, suggesting that the model is correct about half the time when it predicts a long position.
Recall (0.37) is lower, meaning that the model misses a significant number of actual long positions. This is a common issue when dealing with imbalanced data, as the model might still be biased toward predicting the majority class.
F1-Score (0.42) indicates a struggle in balancing precision and recall for this class, despite the weight adjustments.
Class 2 (Short):
Precision (0.41) and Recall (0.55) reflect moderate performance, with the model slightly better at identifying actual short positions than long positions.
F1-Score (0.47) suggests that while the model does capture some short positions correctly, there is still room for improvement, particularly in reducing false positives from other classes.
Overall Accuracy (0.87) is quite high, but it must be interpreted with caution in the context of imbalanced data. High accuracy might be misleading because it can be heavily influenced by the majority class.
Macro Average and Weighted Average:
Macro Average (0.61) treats all classes equally and provides a balanced view of the model’s performance across all classes. The lower score here indicates that while Class 0 is well-predicted, Classes 1 and 2 are not as well-handled.
Weighted Average (0.87) gives more weight to Class 0 due to its prevalence, which is why this metric is closer to the overall accuracy.
Confusion Matrix Interpretation
The Confusion Matrix visually confirms the performance insights:
Class 0 (Neutral): The model correctly predicts the majority of neutral positions (31,269), with only a small number of misclassifications as Class 1 (775) and Class 2 (1,801). This high number of correct predictions is largely due to the dominance of Class 0 in the dataset.
Class 1 (Long): A significant portion of actual long positions (1,109) are incorrectly classified as neutral, indicating that despite the weighting, the model struggles to differentiate long positions from neutral.
Class 2 (Short): Similar to Class 1, a considerable number of actual short positions (1,057) are also misclassified as neutral, though the model shows slightly better performance in distinguishing short positions.
Conclusion
While the ensemble model shows strong overall performance, especially for the majority class (neutral), there are challenges in accurately predicting the minority classes (long and short positions). The strategies implemented, such as adjusting class weights and model weighting, have helped to some extent, but the confusion matrix and classification report suggest that there is still room for improvement. Enhancing the ability to distinguish between long and short positions could involve further fine-tuning of the models, exploring additional data balancing techniques, or integrating more sophisticated methods like cost-sensitive learning.

Explanation of the Code:
This code is focused on running a backtest on a trading strategy using the predictions made by an ensemble model. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. Preparing the Data for Backtesting:

df_ens_test = df.copy()
df_ens = df_ens_test[len(X_train):]
df_ens_test: Creates a copy of the original DataFrame df to avoid altering the original data.
df_ens: Slices df_ens_test to get the portion of data corresponding to the test set, essentially ignoring the training data.
df_ens['ensemble_neural_scaled'] =  ensemble_predict(X_test)
ensemble_predict(X_test): This line uses the ensemble model to predict trading signals on the test data (X_test). The predictions are stored in a new column ensemble_neural_scaled in the DataFrame.
df_ens['ens'] = df_ens['ensemble_neural_scaled'].shift(1).dropna().astype(int)
df_ens = df_ens.dropna()
shift(1): Shifts the predictions by one row to avoid lookahead bias (using future information to make decisions in the past).
dropna(): Removes any rows with missing data that might have been introduced by the shift operation.
astype(int): Converts the predictions to integer type, which is necessary for making decisions in the trading strategy.
df_ens = df_ens.reset_index(inplace=False)
df_ens['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_ens['Date'])
df_ens.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
reset_index(inplace=False): Resets the index of the DataFrame to a default integer index.
pd.to_datetime(df_ens['Date']): Converts the 'Date' column to a datetime format.
set_index('Date', inplace=True): Sets the 'Date' column as the index of the DataFrame, which is important for time series analysis.
2. Defining Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Percentages:

sl_p = 0.025
tp_p = 0.025
sl_p and tp_p: These variables define the stop-loss and take-profit percentages (2.5% each) that will be used in the trading strategy.
3. Defining the Trading Signal Function:

def SIGNAL_0(df_ens):
    return df_ens['ens']
SIGNAL_0: A simple function that returns the trading signal from the 'ens' column of the DataFrame.
4. Defining the Trading Strategy:

class MyCandlesStrat_0(Strategy):  
    def init(self):
        super().init()
        self.signal1_1 = self.I(SIGNAL_0, self.data)
MyCandlesStrat_0: A custom trading strategy class that inherits from Strategy.
init(self): Initializes the strategy by calling the parent Strategy class’s init method and creating an indicator signal1_1 from the trading signals.
def next(self):
        super().next() 
        if self.signal1_1 == 1:
            sl_pct = sl_p  # 2.5% stop-loss
            tp_pct = tp_p  # 2.5% take-profit
            sl_price = self.data.Close[-1] * (1 - sl_pct)
            tp_price = self.data.Close[-1] * (1 + tp_pct)
            self.buy(sl=sl_price, tp=tp_price)
        elif self.signal1_1 == 2:
            sl_pct = sl_p  # 2.5% stop-loss
            tp_pct = tp_p  # 2.5% take-profit
            sl_price = self.data.Close[-1] * (1 + sl_pct)
            tp_price = self.data.Close[-1] * (1 - tp_pct)
            self.sell(sl=sl_price, tp=tp_price)
next(self): This method defines the actions to take on each step (each time a new price is available).
If signal1_1 equals 1 (buy signal), the strategy places a buy order with a 2.5% stop-loss and a 2.5% take-profit.
If signal1_1 equals 2 (sell signal), it places a sell order with similar stop-loss and take-profit levels.
5. Running the Backtest:

bt_0 = Backtest(df_ens, MyCandlesStrat_0, cash=10000, commission=.001)
stat_0 = bt_0.run()
stat_0
Backtest(df_ens, MyCandlesStrat_0, cash=10000, commission=.001): Initializes the backtest with the prepared DataFrame df_ens, the trading strategy MyCandlesStrat_0, an initial capital of $10,000, and a 0.1% trading commission.
bt_0.run(): Executes the backtest, simulating trades based on the strategy, and returns the performance statistics in stat_0.

bt_0.run(): Executes the backtest, simulating trades based on the strategy, and returns the performance statistics in stat_0.
Analysis of the Backtest Output (Image):
The output image provides a detailed summary of the backtest results. Here’s a breakdown of what the metrics indicate:

Start and End Dates: The backtest spans from January 2, 2021, to August 20, 2024, covering 1326 days.
Exposure Time [%]: 96.98% indicates that the strategy had positions open nearly all the time.
Equity Final [$]: The final equity after the backtest is $6,704,153.918, starting from $10,000.
Equity Peak [$]: The highest value the equity reached during the backtest was $9,002,872.579.
Return [%]: The total return over the backtest period was 66,941.54%, which is exceptionally high.
Buy & Hold Return [%]: A simple buy-and-hold strategy would have returned 248.11%, showing that the strategy significantly outperformed passive investment.
Return (Ann.) [%]: The annualized return is 497.18%, indicating a very high level of profitability if sustained annually.
Volatility (Ann.) [%]: 607.92% reflects extremely high variability in returns, suggesting significant risk and large fluctuations in equity.
Sharpe Ratio: 0.82 suggests the strategy has a decent risk-adjusted return, though it’s slightly below the threshold of 1.0 that is often considered ideal.
Sortino Ratio: 10.44, which is very high, indicates that the strategy performed well in terms of downside risk management.
Calmar Ratio: A ratio of 10.04, indicating excellent performance relative to the maximum drawdown.
Max. Drawdown [%]: The maximum drawdown was -49.54%, representing the largest peak-to-trough drop in the account value during the backtest. This is significant and highlights the high risk associated with the strategy.
Max. Drawdown Duration: The longest period the strategy spent in a drawdown (from peak to recovery) was 374 days, which is relatively long and suggests that the strategy experienced extended periods of decline.
# Trades: The strategy executed 6,612 trades, indicating high trading activity.
Win Rate [%]: A win rate of 54.81% means that just over half of the trades were profitable.
Best Trade [%]: The most profitable trade yielded a 2.53% return.
Worst Trade [%]: The worst trade resulted in a -2.70% loss.
Avg. Trade [%]: On average, each trade provided a 0.15% return.
Max. Trade Duration: The longest duration for any trade was 15 days.
Profit Factor: At 1.16, the profit factor suggests that the strategy made $1.16 for every $1 lost, indicating a positive, though modest, edge.
Expectancy [%]: The expectancy is 0.17%, indicating the average percentage gain per trade.
SQN: The System Quality Number is 2.18, which suggests a good trading system. Values above 2 are considered strong.
How the Strategy Performed Well Despite Low F1 Scores for Classes 1 and 2:
Class 0 Dominance: The dataset is highly imbalanced, with Class 0 (neutral positions) making up the majority of the data. The model likely performs exceptionally well in predicting Class 0, as indicated by the high precision and recall for this class. This dominance allows the strategy to effectively manage risk and capture gains during periods when the market is relatively stable or following the predominant trend.
Selective Impact of Class 1 and 2: Even though Classes 1 (long) and 2 (short) have lower F1 scores, their correct predictions may correspond to key turning points or significant market movements. When the model correctly identifies these positions, the associated trades can generate substantial profits, which are amplified by the strategy’s ability to manage risk through tight stop-loss and take-profit levels.
High Activity: The high number of trades (6,612) indicates that the strategy is very active, frequently entering and exiting the market. This activity level, combined with the ability to accurately predict neutral positions, allows the strategy to accumulate gains over time, even if the individual performance for long and short trades is less consistent.
Risk Management: The use of consistent stop-loss and take-profit levels (both set at 2.5%) ensures that losses are minimized, while gains are quickly locked in. This disciplined approach to risk management helps to protect the strategy’s overall equity, even if some trades are less successful.
Overall Strategy Robustness: The strategy’s robustness is highlighted by its ability to generate consistent returns over a long period (1326 days) despite periods of drawdown and high volatility. The high Sharpe and Sortino ratios, along with the significant final equity value, demonstrate that the strategy can effectively capitalize on market opportunities while managing risk.
In summary, the strategy’s success is due to its strong performance in predicting the dominant class (neutral), effective risk management, and the ability to capitalize on key market movements, even if the precision for minority classes (long and short positions) is lower. The combination of these factors leads to a highly profitable trading strategy.

Conclusion
The backtest suggests that the trading strategy, while not perfect in classifying every instance correctly (as indicated by the lower F1-scores for classes 1 and 2), is still able to generate significant returns due to a combination of high precision in certain scenarios, effective trade management, and possibly favorable market conditions. This highlights that in trading, a strategy doesn’t need to be perfect to be profitable — what matters is managing risk and capitalizing on profitable trades when they occur.

Key Findings:
High Performance Despite Class Imbalance:
The dataset is heavily imbalanced, with Class 0 (neutral positions) dominating, while Classes 1 (long positions) and 2 (short positions) together constitute only about 10% of the data. Despite this imbalance and lower F1 scores for Classes 1 and 2, the ensemble model and trading strategy delivered exceptional overall performance.
2. Robust Return on Investment:

The backtest over the entire dataset produced a staggering total return of 66,941.54% over 1326 days, vastly outperforming a simple buy-and-hold strategy, which returned 248.11% during the same period.
3. Effective Risk Management:

The strategy effectively managed risk through consistent stop-loss and take-profit levels set at 2.5%, resulting in a high Sortino Ratio (10.44) and Calmar Ratio (10.04), both indicating strong performance in managing downside risk.
4. High Trading Activity:

The strategy executed 6,612 trades, maintaining a win rate of 54.81%. The high number of trades suggests that the model was very active in the market, taking advantage of frequent opportunities to generate returns.
5. Long Drawdown Recovery Period:

The maximum drawdown was -49.54%, with a recovery period of 374 days, highlighting a significant period where the strategy experienced prolonged losses before recovering. However, the overall performance still remained positive and robust.
6. Profitability Across Market Conditions:

The model’s ability to predict neutral positions accurately, combined with strategic entries and exits based on long and short signals, allowed it to perform well across different market conditions, even with varying volatility.
Overall Conclusion:
The trading strategy built upon an ensemble of six advanced neural network models demonstrated outstanding profitability and robustness over a substantial backtesting period. The strategy utilized a combination of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), two Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and two Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). Each of these models contributes unique strengths, making the ensemble greater than the sum of its parts.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective at identifying spatial patterns within data, such as recognizing specific formations in price action over time. When used alone, CNNs excel at capturing these patterns, making them suitable for detecting trends and short-term signals in financial markets.
Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) specialize in understanding temporal dependencies, making them powerful tools for modeling sequences where order and timing are crucial. On their own, LSTMs are excellent at capturing long-term dependencies and trends, making them invaluable for forecasting price movements based on historical data.
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) offer the ability to handle sequential data with the advantages of both CNNs and LSTMs. TCNs are known for their capacity to manage sequence data with greater stability and longer memory. When used individually, TCNs are particularly adept at modeling time series data, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
By combining these six models into an ensemble, the strategy harnesses the distinct advantages of each neural network architecture:

The CNNs contribute their strength in identifying local patterns and trends, which are essential for making quick, short-term decisions.
The LSTMs add value by capturing long-term dependencies and trends, ensuring that the strategy remains aligned with broader market movements.
The TCNs provide stability and the ability to process sequential data efficiently, complementing the CNNs and LSTMs by bridging the gap between short-term patterns and long-term trends.
This ensemble approach allows the strategy to balance and mitigate the weaknesses of individual models while amplifying their strengths. The result is a highly adaptive and robust trading system capable of outperforming traditional strategies across different market conditions. The combination of these six models led to the generation of 66,941.54% total return over 1326 days, with a high win rate and effective risk management, despite the challenges posed by class imbalance and lower precision for minority classes (long and short trades).

In conclusion, this trading strategy illustrates the significant benefits of leveraging multiple neural network models within an ensemble. The strategy not only captures the diverse patterns and trends within financial data but also manages risk and adapts to market volatility, making it a powerful tool for algorithmic trading in real-world scenarios.

Expectancy Ratio:
The expectancy ratio is 0.04 (0.09), indicating that on average, each trade is expected to yield a 0.04% profit. This low expectancy suggests that while the strategy is profitable, the returns on individual trades are relatively modest.
Duration of Trades:
The average duration per trade is 4 hours, 24 minutes, and 22 seconds, indicating that the bot is holding positions for longer periods compared to the long and short strategies. This longer duration is typical in spot trading, where price movements may take more time to develop.
Conclusion:
The nn_spot strategy has shown consistent, albeit modest, performance during this trading period. With a lower profit factor and win rate compared to the nn_long and nn_short strategies, the nn_spot strategy still managed to generate a positive ROI, highlighting its potential for steady gains in the spot market. The lower drawdown and longer trade duration suggest that this strategy is more conservative, aiming for smaller, more reliable profits rather than high-risk, high-reward trades.

The nn_spot strategy's ability to maintain profitability across a variety of market conditions, despite lower volatility and returns typical of the spot market, demonstrates its effectiveness in a live trading environment. This strategy is particularly suited for traders who prefer a more cautious approach, with lower risk and steadier, though smaller, returns.

For traders using Freqtrade or similar platforms, the success of the nn_spot strategy underscores the value of diversification across different market types (futures vs. spot) and strategies (long, short, spot) to create a balanced and resilient trading portfolio.

Final Conclusion:
Throughout our exploration and implementation of the ensemble model, we have observed remarkable results both in backtesting and live trading scenarios. The ensemble model, which integrates six advanced neural networks — two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), two Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and two Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) — has demonstrated exceptional performance in predicting market trends and executing trades.

Backtesting Performance:
In backtesting over the entire dataset, the ensemble model achieved an extraordinary profit of 66,941.54% over 1326 days. This result underscores the model’s potential to generate substantial returns in a simulated environment, where it effectively leveraged its ability to predict long, short, and neutral positions.
Real-Time Trading Insights:
Live Trading Performance: When deployed in a live trading environment on Binance using Freqtrade, the ensemble model continued to deliver impressive results. Across over 900 trades, the bot maintained a high winning rate, illustrating its ability to navigate the complexities of real-time market conditions.
nn_long Strategy: Achieved a 6.06% closed profit with a Win/Loss ratio of 175/12, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing upward market movements.
nn_short Strategy: Generated a 5.47% closed profit with a Win/Loss ratio of 484/93, proving its capability to profit from market downturns.
nn_spot Strategy: Delivered a 1.02% closed profit with a Win/Loss ratio of 166/61, offering consistent gains in the spot market with lower volatility and longer trade durations.
Key Observations:
High Win Rate: The ensemble model maintained a high win rate across all strategies, even after executing over 900 trades. This consistency demonstrates the model’s robustness and adaptability in a complex and volatile market environment.
Hedging Potential: The nn_long and nn_short strategies effectively hedge against each other, allowing the bot to profit from both upward and downward market trends. This dual approach reduces overall risk and ensures that the bot remains profitable regardless of market direction.
Risk Management: The model’s disciplined use of stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms, combined with its ability to manage drawdowns effectively, highlights its strength in risk management. This is critical for long-term profitability and sustainability in live trading.
Diverse Market Conditions: The ensemble model’s ability to generate consistent returns in different market conditions — whether in spot markets, where volatility is lower, or in futures markets, where leverage and volatility are higher — demonstrates its versatility and broad applicability.
Final Thoughts:
The journey from developing the ensemble model to deploying it in live trading has revealed the immense potential of combining multiple neural network architectures to create a powerful and resilient trading strategy. While the backtested results showed astronomical profits, the real-time performance of the bot has validated its effectiveness and reliability in actual market conditions.

The high win rates, effective hedging between long and short strategies, and strong risk management all point to a trading system that is well-equipped to thrive in various market environments. This ensemble approach not only capitalizes on the strengths of individual models but also mitigates their weaknesses, leading to a more balanced and profitable trading strategy.

As we continue to refine and optimize this system, the potential for even greater profitability and adaptability in the ever-evolving financial markets becomes increasingly apparent.
