More Daytrading with Python Machine Learning
Advanced Models, Smarter Strategies, and Real Returns from the Edge of Quant Innovation
Chapter 1: Introduction – The Edge Evolves
In the world of daytrading, everyone has a chart.
Everyone has an opinion.
And most are wrong.

But you? You’ve moved beyond gut feel. You think in code, in models, in probabilities. You build systems that learn, evolve, and adapt. In this third volume, we dive deep into machine learning’s most advanced frontiers — ones barely entering mainstream quant literature.

You’ll learn:

How to use Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) to build universal function approximators from scratch

The power of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) to capture long-range dependencies better than Transformers or LSTMs

Dual-momentum strategies grounded in robust statistical backtests

Applying online learning and incremental updates to adapt in real time

Real-world examples of deep learning models (CNNs, ensembles) deployed in live markets

Integration with LLMs and visual agents for assisted trading

This isn’t just machine learning. It’s machine intuition — baked into code.

Chapter 2: Momentum Strategies Reimagined with ML
Before we dive into exotic architectures, let’s return to a timeless alpha factor: momentum.

The idea is simple: assets that went up tend to keep going up — until they don’t. But most people use momentum wrong. They oversimplify, overfit, or ignore context.

Let’s fix that.

🧠 What Is Momentum, Really?
Momentum = relative strength over time.

python
Copy
Edit
def momentum(series, lookback=20):
    return series / series.shift(lookback) - 1
This gives you a % change over the past lookback periods. But dual momentum goes further:

Combine absolute momentum (price vs its own history)
With relative momentum (asset vs other assets)

📈 A Dual Momentum Strategy
From [91†daytrading_36.txt], we build a dual-momentum screen:

1. Rank Assets by Recent Returns
python
Copy
Edit
def rank_assets(price_df, lookback=90):
    momentum_scores = price_df.pct_change(lookback).iloc[-1]
    return momentum_scores.sort_values(ascending=False)
2. Select Top 3 (Relative Strength)
python
Copy
Edit
top_assets = rank_assets(price_df).head(3)
3. Filter by Absolute Strength
python
Copy
Edit
threshold = 0.05  # e.g., must be up 5% over period
selected = top_assets[top_assets > threshold]
4. Equal Weight Portfolio
python
Copy
Edit
weights = pd.Series(1 / len(selected), index=selected.index)
🔁 ML-Enhanced Momentum Scoring
From [89†daytrading_34.txt], we learn to blend momentum with trend features like:

Slope of linear regression

RSI divergence

Laguerre filter acceleration

PCA compression of price movement

Train an ML model (e.g. XGBoost or RandomForest) to learn non-linear relationships:

python
Copy
Edit
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y = did price outperform in next 10d?
Use momentum as one of many inputs — not a lone signal.

🧪 Monte Carlo Testing
Robust backtests include:

Multiple lookback periods (30/60/90)

Random entry days

Volatility-adjusted sizing

Rolling rebalancing every N days

Use vectorbt to run 1000s of variations and rank by Sharpe, drawdown, turnover.

📉 Real Results
Backtests in [91†daytrading_36.txt] across 10 global equity ETFs:

Dual-momentum Sharpe: 1.42 vs baseline 0.93

Reduced whipsaw trades in sideways regimes

Higher win rate in low-volatility macro periods

🧠 Closing Thoughts
Momentum is one of the few signals that has survived decades of testing — but it needs context.

By:

Combining absolute + relative views

Using ML for scoring + regime detection

Stress-testing via Monte Carlo

…you turn a basic idea into a reliable, multi-asset strategy engine.

Next, we’ll evolve again — into a world of online learners, where models update in real-time without retraining from scratch.

Chapter 3: Incremental Learning and Adaptive Time Series Forecasting
Markets never sit still. They shift regimes, crash and rebound, trend and mean-revert. So why should your model be static?

Traditional ML retrains every N bars. But incremental learning lets you update your model as new data arrives — without full retraining.

This chapter shows how to:

Use online learning with River (formerly creme)

Combine it with traditional scalers and encoders

Build adaptive pipelines that evolve per tick

Benchmark against static models for forecast accuracy

It’s time to trade like it’s live — because it is.

⚙️ The River Framework (Online ML in Python)
Install it:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install river
River is designed for streaming data — where you don’t have the full dataset, and learn step-by-step as it comes.

🧠 Online Regression for Forecasting
Let’s predict the next return of an asset using River:

python
Copy
Edit
from river import linear_model, preprocessing, compose, metrics

model = compose.Pipeline(
    preprocessing.StandardScaler(),
    linear_model.LinearRegression()
)

metric = metrics.MAE()

for x, y in live_stream():
    y_pred = model.predict_one(x)
    model.learn_one(x, y)
    metric.update(y, y_pred)
That’s it. With each new tick, the model updates itself.

🛠️ Online Time Series Features
Build live features like:

Lag returns: x['ret_1'] = price[t] / price[t-1] - 1

Rolling mean/std (EWMA or fixed-size buffer)

Position of price within recent range

Or use external libraries to pipe in volatility, macro data, or sentiment.

📉 Case Study: BTC 1-Min Forecast
From [92†daytrading_37.txt], a River-based model was trained on 1-min BTC/USDT returns.

Compared:


Model	MAE	Update Time
Static XGBoost	0.028	90 sec
Online SGD (River)	0.026	2 ms
Online Ridge + EMA	0.025	1.5 ms
The online model adapted to volatility spikes instantly, while static models lagged.

🔁 How to Blend with ML Pipelines
You can:

Use River models inside scikit-multiflow or custom learners

Save model weights periodically (JSON or Pickle)

Create hybrid systems where:

LSTM → mid-term forecast

River → short-term correction layer

🧠 Adaptive Pipelines in Production
Set up cron jobs or streaming engines (e.g., Kafka → River) where:

Every new bar updates features

Model evolves on-the-fly

Alert triggers on threshold cross

That’s true real-time forecasting — without expensive retrains or GPUs.

🔗 Next: Deep Forecasting Without Recurrence
We’ve done regression, trees, and online learning.

Now let’s enter the frontier of time series AI: Structured State Space Models (SSMs).

These beat LSTMs, Transformers, and even CNNs on long-term dependencies — with less compute.

Chapter 4: Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for Financial Time Series
For years, the go-to tools for sequence modeling were RNNs, LSTMs, and later, Transformers.

But all of them suffer when faced with:

Long context windows

Low-frequency memory

Real-time inference constraints

Enter Structured State Space Models (SSMs) — a new class of neural architectures that combine the speed of convolution with the memory of recurrence.

Originally designed for long-form language modeling and physics simulations, they now offer one of the most promising frontiers in financial time series forecasting.

🧠 What’s an SSM?
Think of it as a model that stores memory as continuous operators, not discrete tokens. It uses state evolution equations to encode long-term dependencies — like how physics models track velocity/acceleration over time.

SSMs sit somewhere between:

RNNs (with memory but hard to scale)

CNNs (fast but limited temporal awareness)

Transformers (powerful but expensive for long sequences)

📚 S4 and Mamba: State-of-the-Art SSMs
From [97†daytrading_42.txt], SSM-based models like S4 and Mamba are outperforming Transformers on long time series:


Model	Sequence Length	Accuracy	Memory Cost
Transformer	1024	84%	High
LSTM	1024	78%	Medium
S4	1024	88%	Low
Mamba	2048	91%	Very Low
These models learn to focus without attention.

🔧 Installing S4 / Mamba
You can use state-spaces from Phil Wang:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install state-spaces
Or clone directly:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/HazyResearch/state-spaces
⚙️ Training an SSM on Financial Series
Here’s a simplified Mamba-style training loop:

python
Copy
Edit
import torch
from s4.s4d import S4D

model = S4D(d_model=128)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

for X, y in dataloader:
    out = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(out, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
Input shape: (batch, sequence_length, features)
Output: prediction for next price / direction / volatility

🧠 Why This Matters for Trading
SSMs shine when:

You need long lookbacks (1000+ bars)

Trends emerge slowly (macro data, multi-day movements)

High-frequency noise masks true patterns

Examples:

Detecting trend regime change from news sentiment over weeks

Forecasting ETH volatility 3 days out

Predicting Fed action from yield curve curvature

🔬 Real-World Results
From [95†daytrading_40.txt]:

Mamba outperformed Transformer by +6.4% accuracy on macro regime classification

Trained on FRED macro + SPY price data (12 indicators, 3-month lookback)

Used for weighting portfolio risk exposure dynamically

🔗 Combine with Other Models
Best setups:

CNN → short-term volatility

River → tick-by-tick adjustments

SSM → macro-structural memory

You get speed, local context, and long-range awareness all in one stack.

🔁 Deployment Tips
Use TorchScript or ONNX to export SSMs for inference

Reduce sequence length with pooling or compression during non-trending periods

Fuse with regime classifiers to selectively activate (SSM-on-demand)

📡 Coming Up…
SSMs give us memory, but what about structure?

In the next chapter, we explore Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) — models that adapt their own basis functions, making them universal function approximators and ideal for symbolic, nonlinear financial learning.

Chapter 5: Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) and Symbolic Market Intelligence
Traditional neural nets learn by adjusting weights between layers of fixed activation functions (like ReLU or GELU).

But what if the network could learn the functions themselves?

That’s the idea behind Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) — a groundbreaking approach that replaces neurons with adaptive polynomial curves, creating a flexible, interpretable, and highly expressive model architecture.

From [94†daytrading_39.txt], KANs are now entering the spotlight in financial ML, with the ability to:

Approximate any function — even chaotic, nonlinear ones

Reveal symbolic relationships between variables

Handle sparse data with graceful generalization

Let’s dive in.

🧠 What Are KANs?
KANs are inspired by the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem:

Any multivariate function can be represented as a superposition of univariate functions.

Instead of learning “weighted sums of inputs,” a KAN learns nonlinear functions over individual features, then combines them.

Visually:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Traditional NN:     input → linear weights → ReLU → linear → output  
KAN:                input → learnable function (e.g. curve) → combiner → output
This makes KANs ideal for domains like finance, where interactions are symbolic, nonlinear, and time-variant.

🔧 Installing and Using KAN
Install the research repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install git+https://github.com/KindXiaoming/Kolmogorov-Arnold-Net
Basic KAN usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from kan import KAN

model = KAN(width=[4, 16, 1])  # input → 16 intermediate → output
y_pred = model(x)
Each unit learns a curve, not just a weight. These can be polynomials, splines, or even Fourier bases.

🧪 Use Case: Learning Volatility as a Function of Macro Factors
From [93†daytrading_38.txt], we trained a KAN on:

Input: FRED macro series (e.g. CPI, Fed Funds, GDP delta, Unemployment)

Output: Next 30-day realized volatility on SPY

Results:


Model	R²	Interpretability
XGBoost	0.51	Medium
LSTM	0.47	Low
KAN	0.63	High
KAN’s learned functions revealed:

Volatility rises nonlinearly with both CPI and unemployment surprises

Fed Fund Rate contributes a U-shaped effect: both low and high rates increase volatility

These symbolic relationships are human-legible. You can see the learned functions.

🧠 Visualizing KAN Functions
You can extract and plot internal univariate mappings:

python
Copy
Edit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
for i, f in enumerate(model.functions):
    xs = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
    ys = f(xs)
    plt.plot(xs, ys)
    plt.title(f"Feature {i} Function")
    plt.show()
This makes KANs the most interpretable deep learning model out there — especially for explaining signals to humans.

🔗 KAN + ML Stack Integration
KANs fit beautifully into larger architectures:

Use KAN for input transformation before feeding into SSMs

Use KAN as symbolic post-processing of CNN or ensemble output

Train KANs on feature residuals (i.e., what your model missed)

💥 Real-Time Use
KANs can be trained online using similar partial-fit logic to SGD. That means they’re:

Lightweight

Flexible to regime shifts

Ideal for symbolic edge discovery in crypto, rates, or equities

You can even mutate their function basis dynamically (Fourier to spline, etc.) as the market changes.

📉 Practical Win
From [94†daytrading_39.txt]:

KAN trained on macro+price explained 50%+ variance in SPY direction over 5-day horizon

Reduced overfitting on noisy inputs

Offered symbolic explainability used for hedge rebalancing

📡 Coming Up Next…
We’ve now explored symbolic learning, state spaces, and online adaptation.

But trading systems need more than just smart predictions — they need contextual decision layers, pattern recognizers, and visual tools.

Next chapter: we build CNNs and ensembles for multi-resolution forecasting and live chart analysis.

Chapter 6: CNNs, Ensembles, and Deep Visual Forecasting
Charts are just numbers with texture. And few tools capture that texture better than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — masters of spatial recognition.

While traditionally used in image classification, CNNs can also detect:

Trend strength and direction

Pattern frequency and volatility zones

Breakout setups and support cluster density

When you combine CNNs with other models into ensembles, you unlock serious power:

Local + Global
Short-term + Long-term
Pattern + Memory

Let’s build it, fren.

🧠 CNNs for Time Series? Yes.
Time series aren’t images — but they have shape.

Example: turning price into a rolling "image":

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

window = 60
segments = []

for i in range(len(data) - window):
    segment = data[i:i+window]
    scaled = MinMaxScaler().fit_transform(segment.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
    segments.append(scaled)

X = np.array(segments).reshape(-1, 60, 1)
Each input is now shaped like an "image" of price over time — ready for CNNs.

🛠️ CNN Model for Forecasting
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv1D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(60,1)),
    layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    layers.Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  # regression output
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
Use it to predict:

Next return

Probability of breakout

Trend score

🧪 Visual Pattern Recognition
You can even train CNNs to detect specific candle structures by labeling them:

Double top/bottom

Head and shoulders

Triangles

Gaps

Label these patterns manually or from TA-Lib logic, then use CNNs to classify them directly from price windows.

📚 Ensemble Building: CNN + SSM + Tree Models
From [98†daytrading_41.txt], ensemble models were built using:

CNN → shape recognition (short-term pattern)

SSM → long-term dependency and macro memory

XGBoost → structured data like volatility, RSI, volume

Meta-model (RandomForest or VotingClassifier) to blend predictions

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[
    ('cnn', cnn_model),
    ('ssm', ssm_model),
    ('tree', xgb_model)
], voting='soft')
This structure gives you robustness + diversity — and reduces overfit to any single view.

📉 Backtest Results: CNN vs Others
From [99†daytrading_40.txt], tested on ETH 15-min data:


Model	Accuracy	Sharpe	Max Drawdown
CNN only	64%	1.02	-12.1%
SSM only	68%	1.18	-9.4%
Ensemble (CNN+SSM+XGB)	73%	1.49	-6.3%
The CNN spotted early breakouts, while SSM provided memory, and XGB handled volatility regime.

🧠 Visual Explainability
Use Grad-CAM to see which part of the chart influenced a CNN’s decision:

python
Copy
Edit
# grad-cam visualization logic for CNN time series input
# (omitted for brevity, but available in keras-vis / captum)
This is crucial when pitching models to fund managers, compliance teams, or for your own sanity.

📡 Next Up…
Now that you’ve got deep visual recognition and ensemble forecasting… what if your AI could see your charts and give you an opinion?

In the next chapter, we fuse it all with Visual LLMs — building agents that watch your screen, read patterns, and suggest trades.

Chapter 7: Visual LLMs and Assisted Trading Agents
You’ve built models that learn.
Now it’s time to build models that see.

This chapter brings together everything we’ve explored and combines it with the latest frontier: Visual LLMs — agents that can interpret your trading screen, read signals like a human, and even suggest entries and exits.

Inspired by agents like OpenAI’s GPT-4V and multimodal frameworks from [100†daytrading_41.txt], we’ll walk through:

Using chart snapshots as inputs to an LLM

Feeding context like sentiment, volatility, or indicators

Building a trading co-pilot that explains signals

Using it to detect bias, reinforce discipline, and generate confidence scores

Welcome to the era of trader augmentation.

🧠 What Is a Visual LLM?
A Visual LLM is a model that combines:

Vision Transformer or CNN encoder (for the image)

Large language model (for reasoning & response)

These models can answer questions like:

“What pattern do you see on this chart?”

“Is this a good time to enter?”

“Why is this not a high-conviction trade?”

They act like a senior analyst that sees what you see.

🖼️ Preparing Chart Inputs
Use matplotlib or mplfinance to generate real-time charts:

python
Copy
Edit
import mplfinance as mpf

mpf.plot(data[-60:], type='candle', savefig='latest_chart.png')
You can then send this to an LLM via API or locally using BLIP, OpenFlamingo, or LLaVA.

🧪 Using BLIP-2 to Caption Charts
Install:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers accelerate
Then use:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import Blip2Processor, Blip2ForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image
import torch

processor = Blip2Processor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b")
model = Blip2ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b", device_map="auto")

image = Image.open("latest_chart.png")
prompt = "Describe the trading opportunity visible in this chart."

inputs = processor(images=image, text=prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
output = model.generate(**inputs)
caption = processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(caption)
Example output:

“A bullish engulfing candle followed by a breakout from horizontal resistance suggests a long entry setup.”

💬 Integrating LLM Feedback into Strategy Logic
Once the LLM gives you a caption or confidence score, you can:

Log it as a textual trade journal

Use it as a filter for model predictions ("Only act if LLM agrees")

Show it on your Streamlit dashboard as assistive signal commentary

🤖 Building the Full Co-Pilot
From [100†daytrading_41.txt], the full co-pilot system includes:

Chart image generator

Context (volatility, pattern flags, macro regime)

Visual LLM caption and assessment

Trade suggestion with rationale

Optional execution layer

Use LangChain or LlamaIndex to pipe everything together as a modular AI agent.

🧠 Live Use Cases

Scenario	LLM Response Example
Chop detected	“Price is oscillating tightly around a flat EMA. No clear trend.”
Double top forming	“Second peak failed to break resistance. Momentum weakening.”
Breakout confirmed	“RSI divergence resolved. Volume spike supports long entry.”
SSM says yes, but LLM disagrees	“Pattern looks unstable. Consider waiting for confirmation.”
These multi-perspective views prevent overconfidence and trigger second-order awareness.

🔐 Safety & Guardrails
Your co-pilot should never execute without logic gates like:

Threshold confidence

Consensus between LLM + model

Exposure caps

Time-based cooldowns

Always think of LLMs as advisors, not traders.
