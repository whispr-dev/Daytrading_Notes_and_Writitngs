🧰 The Beginner's Blueprint to Day Trading with Python
Part 3: Tools of the Trade — Python Libraries You’ll Actually Use
✦ Why Python?
Python is beloved by traders for the same reason it’s loved by scientists, ML engineers, and data nerds:

Simple syntax

Giant ecosystem

Rock-solid libraries for stats, finance, plotting, automation

It’s readable, fast to prototype, and powerful under the hood

And we’re going to exploit every bit of that.

🧱 Let’s Build Your Core Stack
Install this base toolkit from your terminal or WSL:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib plotly streamlit scikit-learn vaderSentiment zipline-reloaded pyfolio
Here’s What Each One Does:

Library	What it does
yfinance	Pulls historical & live market data from Yahoo Finance
pandas/numpy	The go-to tools for handling tabular data and calculations
matplotlib	Basic plotting (we’ll mostly use plotly, but still useful)
plotly	Fancy, interactive charts (candles, overlays, etc.)
streamlit	Turns your scripts into slick, interactive trading dashboards
sklearn	Machine learning and error metrics for evaluation
vaderSentiment	Natural language processing to gauge news sentiment
zipline-reloaded	Backtesting engine to simulate strategies on historical data
pyfolio	Portfolio performance/risk visualization from backtests
🐍 Make Your Workspace Nice
Project folder layout suggestion (optional but clean af):

│   ├── candlestick_plot.py
│   └── indicator_overlay.py
├── data/
├── strategies/
├── dashboards/
├── backtests/
├── bots/
└── README.md
Each part of this tutorial will give you fully self-contained .py files to drop into folders like core_concepts/, backtests/, or strategies/.

🕸️ Fetching Data with yfinance
Let’s pull some real stock data and get familiar with the format.

Save as:
📄 core_concepts/fetch_data.py

python
Copy
Edit
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Get daily data for AAPL over the last 6 months
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, period='6mo', interval='1d')

print(data.head())
This gives you a DataFrame with:

               Open    High     Low   Close  Adj Close     Volume
Date                                                            
2023-10-19  173.30  175.27  172.99  174.91      174.91   50476600
2023-10-20  174.98  175.75  171.96  172.88      172.88   53022000
...
Let’s now plot the closing price using plotly:

📄 core_concepts/plot_closing.py

python
Copy
Edit
import yfinance as yf
import plotly.express as px

data = yf.download("AAPL", period="6mo", interval="1d")
fig = px.line(data, x=data.index, y='Close', title='AAPL Closing Price')
fig.show()
📊 Streamlit: Your First Trading Dashboard
Create a fast dashboard you can run locally.

📄 dashboards/aapl_dashboard.py

python
Copy
Edit
import streamlit as st
import yfinance as yf
import plotly.graph_objects as go

st.title("📈 AAPL Mini Dashboard")

# Get data
data = yf.download("AAPL", period="3mo", interval="1d")

# Plot candlesticks
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(
    x=data.index,
    open=data['Open'],
    high=data['High'],
    low=data['Low'],
    close=data['Close']
))

fig.update_layout(xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False)

st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
Run with:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run dashboards/aapl_dashboard.py
💡 You’ll get an interactive browser-based dashboard. Want to add an RSI/EMA selector or sentiment feed? We’ll wire those in soon.

📰 Real-Time News + Sentiment
Want to read the news and see if it’s bullish or bearish?

📄 core_concepts/sentiment_news.py

python
Copy
Edit
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

sample_headlines = [
    "Apple stock jumps 5% after strong iPhone sales",
    "Investors worry about Fed rate hikes",
    "Tesla faces new competition from Rivian"
]

for headline in sample_headlines:
    sentiment = analyzer.polarity_scores(headline)
    print(f"{headline} → {sentiment['compound']:.3f}")
compound > 0.05 → Positive

compound < -0.05 → Negative

Between → Neutral

Later we’ll grab live headlines from Yahoo Finance using scraping/APIs and visualize rolling sentiment over time.

✦ Toolchain Recap
By now, you should be able to:

Pull stock data using yfinance

Plot interactive price charts using plotly

Create a basic dashboard with streamlit

Measure sentiment from text using vaderSentiment

✦ Coming Up Next: Naive Strategies and Forecasting
In Part 4, we’ll get analytical:

Build a naive price prediction model (using yesterday’s close)

Evaluate it using RMSE, MAE, R²

Plot predictions vs real prices

Prove that “simple” can beat nothing — and benchmark future strategies against it
