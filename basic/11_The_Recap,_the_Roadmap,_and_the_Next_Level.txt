Part 11: The Recap, the Roadmap, and the Next Level
✦ What You've Built
Over the course of this tutorial, you’ve built:

✔ Price Analysis Tools
• Candlestick charts
• EMA, RSI, MACD, VWAP
• Real-time volume and sentiment overlays

✔ Naive Model + Benchmarking
• First price predictor
• SMAPE, RMSE, MAE metrics
• Visual forecast vs reality

✔ Indicator Overlays
• Multi-pane charts
• RSI/MACD diagnostics
• Candles + volume with Plotly

✔ Stock Screener
• S&P 500 pull
• 52-week high/low scanner
• Market cap + RSI filters
• Excel export with full dataframe

✔ Option Payoff Simulator
• Binary calls/puts
• Heaviside visualization
• Black-Scholes digital valuation

✔ Backtesting Framework
• Mean reversion model
• Zipline simulation
• Weekly rebalance logic
• Pyfolio full risk analysis

✔ Real Browser Bot
• Fidelity login via pyautogui + Shortkeys
• Secure partial credential handling
• Page scrape and element click automation

✔ Fully Functional Trading Bot
• MACD + RSI + VWAP strategy
• Alpaca paper/live execution
• Modular architecture
• Logging, alerts, and signal logic

You now have a skeleton to build any strategy on top of.

✦ What Comes Next?
1. Expand Your Strategy Library
Try new models:

EMA crossovers (9/21, 20/50)

Bollinger Band reversion

News-based sentiment filter (use VADER with Yahoo headlines)

Intraday volatility + volume spikes

2. Backtest Everything
Use:

zipline-reloaded

backtrader

vectorbt (blazing fast, great for research)

Benchmark your ideas against:

SPY (buy-and-hold)

AAPL

Random strategies

If it can't beat random… don't trade it.

3. Real Execution Tips
🛡️ Always start in paper mode
🔐 Never expose full keys
💾 Log every trade with:

Time

Signal type

Price

Position size
📉 Visualize drawdowns — your emotions will betray you if you don’t prepare

4. Optional: Add Machine Learning
Yes, you can add:

LSTMs for forecasting

Reinforcement learning for trade decision

Random Forests to classify “good” vs “bad” setups

But… don’t start there.
Only add ML once your strategy logic is solid.

5. Portfolio-Level Stuff
Eventually you’ll want:

Multiple asset strategies

Risk parity balancing

Automatic rebalancers

Sharpe/Sortino optimizers

Use:

cvxpy for constraint-based optimizers

pyfolio or empyrical for metrics

quantstats for beautiful reports

6. Schedule and Scale It
For a real-world deployment:

Use crontab or systemd (Linux)

Log to file or SQLite

Run a daily .py bot that pulls, evaluates, trades

Bonus:

Use streamlit to build a web dashboard to view your bot in action

✦ Final Thoughts
You’ve now:

Written real trading strategies

Backtested across a decade of data

Built interactive visual dashboards

Created secure, stealthy browser bots

Wired in real broker APIs

Learned the real logic behind signals, risk, and execution

And you did it with nothing but open tools and Python.
