ðŸ§  Section 1: From Beginner to Advanced â€” The Quant Mindset Shift
You've built a bot. You've coded RSI/MACD/VWAP. Maybe you've backtested with Zipline. You know how to get the data.
But now, you want alpha â€” real edge â€” and not just technical indicators dressed up in strategy wrappers.

Welcome to the advanced tier.

This level is where traders:

Integrate liquidity signals

Use cointegration instead of correlation

Merge machine learning forecasts with market structure

Build frameworks, not just scripts

Combine neural nets, risk theory, and trend logic into actionable systems

It's not about building the perfect model.
Itâ€™s about building a process that adapts â€” and automates â€” insight.

So letâ€™s go beyond the basics.
Letâ€™s walk through live examples that combine:

âœ” Statistical edge (mean reversion, volatility smoothing)
âœ” Machine learning (XGBoost, LSTM)
âœ” Execution frameworks (Backtrader, Alpaca, Pandas, PyTorch)
âœ” Real trend classification pipelines

Each technique we'll explore was drawn from real-world hedge fund workflows, community open-source research, or published alpha-hunting methods.
