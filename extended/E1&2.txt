Extended Daytrading with Python
Advanced Tools, Patterns, and Forecasting Techniques
Chapter 1: Introduction â€“ Beyond the Technicals
In Further Daytrading with Python, we explored how to build intelligent, model-driven strategies using neural nets, anomaly detection, and live dashboards.

In this volume, we venture deeper into the macro-structural, probabilistic, and statistical foundations of modern quant trading â€” while still keeping our boots firmly on the ground with real Python code and market-tested tools.

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll master in this book:

Building stationary series pipelines for robust forecasting

Using Monte Carlo simulations to assess strategy risk

Implementing real-time candlestick pattern scanning

Classifying market regimes with PCA and KMeans

Running backtests using vectorbt with full parameter sweeps

Enhancing models with macroeconomic indicators from FRED

Automating support/resistance detection with 7 algorithmic methods

Using triple-barrier labeling for more accurate supervised learning targets

No fluff, no vague theory â€” everything in this book is a real tool you can code, test, and deploy.

Letâ€™s start by fixing something that quietly breaks many models: non-stationary data.

Chapter 2: Making Time Series Stationary â€“ The Forgotten Step
Before you throw your data into XGBoost, PatchTST, or even a simple LSTM â€” thereâ€™s one critical thing to check:

Is your time series stationary?

ðŸ“‰ Why Stationarity Matters
A stationary series has constant mean and variance over time. Many ML and statistical models â€” especially ones with assumptions like normality, autocorrelation, or linearity â€” break silently on non-stationary data.

Itâ€™s like trying to measure a moving target with a fixed ruler.

Take SPYâ€™s closing prices:

python
Copy
Edit
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

spy = yf.Ticker("SPY")
data = spy.history(period="10y")

plt.plot(data.index, data['Close'])
plt.title('SPY Price - Non-Stationary')
The chart trends up â€” clearly non-stationary. But if we take returns, the mean and variance stabilize:

python
Copy
Edit
returns = data['Close'].pct_change().dropna()
plt.plot(returns)
plt.title('SPY Returns - Stationary')
ðŸ§ª The ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)
Use this to verify stationarity statistically:

python
Copy
Edit
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

def get_p_value(series):
    result = adfuller(series.dropna(), autolag='AIC')
    return result[1]

print("P-value for SPY price:", get_p_value(data['Close']))
print("P-value for returns:", get_p_value(returns))
If p < 0.05, the series is likely stationary.

ðŸ”„ Making Any Series Stationary
Hereâ€™s a transformer-style pipeline:

stationarize.py
python
Copy
Edit
def make_stationary(df, col='y'):
    df['pct_change'] = df[col].pct_change()
    df['log_diff'] = np.log(df[col]) - np.log(df[col].shift(1))
    df['zscore'] = (df['pct_change'] - df['pct_change'].mean()) / df['pct_change'].std()
    return df.dropna()
Use .pct_change() or .log_diff() for most price/volume series. Standardize (zscore) if needed for ML.

âš¡ PatchTST: Proof in Prediction
From [71â€ source], two identical PatchTST models were trained â€” one on raw prices, one on returns.

Same horizon, hyperparams, architecture

Stationary input â†’ 20%+ lower RMSE

Non-stationary model lagged on reversals and spiked errors in trends

Conclusion: even modern Transformers benefit from clean input.

ðŸ”§ Advanced Tip: Auto-Stationarization in Pipeline
Build a wrapper that auto-checks and transforms input:

python
Copy
Edit
def auto_stationarize(series):
    if get_p_value(series) > 0.05:
        return series.pct_change().dropna()
    return series
Use it during feature engineering to future-proof your models.

ðŸ§  Coming Upâ€¦
Now that youâ€™ve built clean input pipelines, letâ€™s add macro intelligence. In the next chapter, weâ€™ll fetch macroeconomic indicators from FRED and integrate them as exogenous variables â€” enabling true regime-aware modeling.
