Chapter 4: Monte Carlo Simulation for Trading Risk Estimation
So you've built a smart trading system — maybe even profitable in backtests. But here's the question:

How confident are you that it’ll survive future randomness?

This chapter gives you the answer — by simulating thousands of possible futures using Monte Carlo simulation.

We’ll learn how to:

Generate realistic return paths using bootstrapping or statistical models

Incorporate volatility scaling and fat tails

Simulate drawdowns, max loss streaks, and time-to-recovery

Use histograms of outcomes to quantify risk

🎲 Why Monte Carlo?
Backtests only tell us what would’ve happened under one path — the real one.

Monte Carlo creates many synthetic futures using your strategy logic, revealing things like:

What if volatility was 2x higher?

What’s the 5th percentile outcome?

How likely is a -40% drawdown?

This gives you confidence intervals and stress test scenarios.

🧪 Core Setup: Simulating Return Paths
Let’s say you have a historical return series:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

returns = np.random.normal(0.001, 0.02, 1000)  # mock daily returns
We simulate N futures:

python
Copy
Edit
def monte_carlo_sim(returns, n=1000, days=252):
    paths = np.zeros((n, days))
    for i in range(n):
        sampled_returns = np.random.choice(returns, size=days, replace=True)
        paths[i] = np.cumprod(1 + sampled_returns)
    return paths
Then plot:

python
Copy
Edit
paths = monte_carlo_sim(returns)
plt.plot(paths.T, alpha=0.05)
plt.title("Monte Carlo Simulations of Price Paths")
plt.xlabel("Days")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Return")
plt.show()
📉 Histogram of Outcomes
What does year-end PnL look like across simulations?

python
Copy
Edit
final_returns = paths[:, -1]
plt.hist(final_returns, bins=50, alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(np.mean(final_returns), color='blue', label='Mean')
plt.axvline(np.percentile(final_returns, 5), color='red', label='5th Percentile')
plt.legend()
plt.title("Distribution of Simulated Final PnLs")
You now have a probabilistic picture of how risky your strategy is.

🧠 Add More Realism
You can incorporate:

🌀 Volatility Clustering (GARCH)
Use GARCH(1,1) to simulate more realistic swings:

python
Copy
Edit
from arch import arch_model
model = arch_model(returns, vol='Garch', p=1, q=1)
fit = model.fit(disp='off')
simulated = fit.simulate(nsimulations=252, repetitions=1000)
🐘 Fat Tails
Replace normal with t-distribution:

python
Copy
Edit
np.random.standard_t(df=4, size=252)
📏 Drawdown Tracking
Add max drawdown metric per path:

python
Copy
Edit
def max_drawdown(path):
    cum_max = np.maximum.accumulate(path)
    dd = (path - cum_max) / cum_max
    return dd.min()
Then aggregate drawdowns across all simulations.

📋 Monte Carlo Risk Report
Build this summary table per strategy:


Metric	Value
Mean PnL	+12.3%
5th Percentile PnL	-18.7%
Worst Drawdown	-33.2%
Median Win Rate	56%
Recovery Time	4.7 months
Prob. of Ruin	3.1%
Use this for risk budgeting, position sizing, or trader confidence.

🔄 Bootstrapped Barriers
From [76†source], you can apply Monte Carlo at the barrier level (e.g. triple-barrier label thresholds):

Vary stop-loss levels

Re-randomize label boundaries

Assess label volatility by regime

This leads to robust supervised learning, especially for directional classifiers.

🔗 Coming Up…
Monte Carlo gives you confidence under stress. Now, let’s go further and:

Label the data more intelligently (triple-barrier)

Detect regimes with PCA + clustering

Build real-world strategies around these forecasts

All coming next.
