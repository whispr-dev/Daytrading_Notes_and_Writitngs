Chapter 4: Monte Carlo Simulation for Trading Risk Estimation
You've built a model. You've tested it on historical data. It looks great. But here’s the dirty secret of backtesting:

Past performance isn’t just no guarantee of future results — it may have been a total accident.

To know whether your model is robust, you need to throw it into a thousand alternate timelines and see if it still survives. That’s what Monte Carlo simulation is for — and it’s one of the most underrated tools in your quiver.

🎲 What Is Monte Carlo Simulation?
It’s a way to simulate future price paths using randomized returns, volatility shocks, or bootstrap sampling, then run your strategy across each one.

It answers questions like:

What’s the worst-case drawdown I could face?

How often does my strategy blow up vs win?

What’s the probability of a 20% gain over 6 months?

🔍 Method 1: Historical Bootstrapping
Use actual returns — shuffled or resampled — to simulate alternate futures.

import numpy as np

returns = df['Close'].pct_change().dropna().values
start_price = df['Close'].iloc[-1]

simulations = []
n_paths = 1000
n_days = 252

for _ in range(n_paths):
    sampled_returns = np.random.choice(returns, size=n_days, replace=True)
    path = start_price * np.cumprod(1 + sampled_returns)
    simulations.append(path)
